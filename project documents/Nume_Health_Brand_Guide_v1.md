# Brand Positioning
Category: Direct-to-patient metabolic health + telehealth weight management.
Core promise: physician-led plans, clear pricing, and ongoing support so patients can sustain results.
Differentiators:
- Physician-led: real clinical oversight, not an anonymous intake funnel.
- Transparent: pricing, what’s included, and what happens if you’re not approved.
- Sustainable: coaching + monitoring to reduce churn and improve outcomes.
- Quality-first: pharmacy standards, cold-chain/shipping practices where applicable, and education.
# Audience & Use Cases
- New prospects researching GLP-1 options and comparing providers.
- Patients who want a guided, accountable program (not just medication).
- People skeptical of compounding and looking for transparency and safety.
# Voice & Tone
Voice: calm, clinical, supportive. Avoid hype, shame, or aggressive urgency.
Tone rules:
- Lead with clarity and support (not fear or vanity).
- Use plain language; define clinical terms.
- Be transparent about risks and eligibility; don’t overpromise.
- Prefer evidence-forward phrasing: 'may', 'can help', 'results vary'.
# Messaging Framework
Primary headline formula:
- Outcome + credibility: 'Physician-led GLP-1 care that fits your life.'
- Speed + safety: 'Start online. Get reviewed by a licensed clinician.'
- Sustainability: 'A plan you can keep - not a quick fix.'
CTA language (preferred): Start Assessment • Check Eligibility • See Pricing • Talk to Support
