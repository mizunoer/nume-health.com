# Site files moved to repo root

The deployable site (index.html, assets/, inc/, etc.) now lives at the **repository root**, not in this folder.

**Deploy:** Point your domain’s document root at the repo root so it serves `index.html`, `assets/`, and the rest from there.

See the root [README.md](../README.md) and [docs/DEPLOY-LITESPEED.md](../docs/DEPLOY-LITESPEED.md).
